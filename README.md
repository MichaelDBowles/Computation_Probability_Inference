# Computation_Probability_Inference
(written in Python 3.5)
Sample Space Generator (limited to value of outcomes possible, list)
Intended to help computation for probability in code that requires a sample space. 
The sample space generator isn't a comprehensive sample space tool, but it does these following tasks well: 
  interacts with user: asks for a mathematical expression that can evaluate to maximum number of outcomes
  prints integer list output in chronological order
  makes sampleSpace, the name of the list
