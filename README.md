# Sample_Space_Generator
(written in Python 3.5)
Sample Space Generator (limited to value of outcomes possible, list)
Intended to help computate for probability that requires a sample space. 
Intended for user to create, access and use a list that might otherwise be more burdensome to create.
The sample space generator isn't a comprehensive sample space tool, but it does these following tasks well: 
  interacts with user: asks for a mathematical expression that can evaluate to maximum number of outcomes
  prints integer list output in chronological order
